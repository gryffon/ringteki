                    <h3 id='decks'>Adding Decks</h3>
                    <p>Start by making sure you have created an account and are logged in. You must be logged in to add decks and spectate or play games. Jigoku Online has a functional <Link href='/decks'>Deckbuilder</Link>, although most people use the more fully featured <a target='_blank' href='https://fiveringsdb.com/'>FiveRingsDB</a> deckbuilder to build their decks. After building your deck on FiveRingsDB, copy the Permalink URL, paste it into popup window in the deckbuilder that is brought up when you click 'Import Deck'. You are now ready to start playing. Head over to the <Link href='/play'>Play</Link> section to create, join or watch games.</p>

                    { /*<p>If you are new to Thrones 2.0, you can find an introductory Stark deck <a target='_blank' href='http://thronesdb.com/deck/view/358860'>here</a>, and an introductory Lannister/Tyrell deck <a target='_blank' href='http://thronesdb.com/deck/view/358861'>here</a>. Both decks only feature cards from the Core Set. If you are new and using any of these decks to play be sure to check the ‘Beginner’ category when creating your game, so you don’t necessarily get destroyed by an up to date power deck. If that happens anyway, just keep practicing and you’ll get the hang of it soon enough.</p>*/ }

                    <h3 id='profile'>Profile Options</h3>
                    <p>Clicking your <Link href='/profile'>Profile</Link> at the top right of the page allows you to tailor certain aspects of gameplay to your wishes.</p>

                    <h4 id='action'>Action Windows</h4>
                    <p>Legend of the Five Rings has quite a large number of phases and their associated action windows, a number of which are not used regularly by all decks. Always prompting these action windows leads to a lot of tediously clicking ‘Pass’, while never prompting these action windows leads to certain cards not being able to be used to their fullest extent. To solve this issue you can check/uncheck any action windows in your profile to determine when you’ll be prompted or not.</p>

                    { /*<p>For example: if you play cards like <a target='_blank' href='https://thronesdb.com/card/01088'>The Tickler</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://thronesdb.com/card/06031'>Wex Pyke</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://thronesdb.com/card/01130'>Messenger Raven</a> or <a target='_blank' href='https://thronesdb.com/card/01139'>Take the Black</a> in your deck, be sure to check Dominance Actions in your profile. Your action window settings can also be changed during a game by clicking the triangle above the ‘Done’/‘Pass’ button.</p>*/ }

                    <h4 id='timed'>Timed Interrupt Window</h4>
                    <p>The combination of automated gameplay and the ability to play reactions or interrupts from hand has the potential to “leak” information about what your opponent might hold in his or her hand. For example: if after playing an event there is a pause before it resolves, you might guess correctly that was due to your opponent being prompted to use Voice of Honor. To solve this issue, the Timed Interrupt Window was created. Depending on which options you have checked, you get a timed prompt during certain triggers asking for interrupts whether you are able to interrupt these triggers or not. Now your opponent experiences the same pause any time and won’t be able to correctly guess whether you’re holding certain cards anymore.</p>

                    <p>There are a couple of options: you can decide whether you want to always be prompted for triggered card abilities , events or both. The timer duration can be modified too. Obviously, if you don’t care about leaking cards from your hand (or you don’t play these cards anyway) and just want a quick game, deselecting both options will allow for that. You will still get prompted to use the aforementioned cards, but only when you actually have them.</p>

                    <h3 id='bugs'>Bugs and automation</h3>
                    <p>While Jigoku Online is still a work in progress and the vast majority of cards are not currently implemented. We try to keep a list up to date with the current state of the automation which can be found <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTfjJyIfytvvQWpAsx_szP3rRwbRMpNXtivQJtA5g3o/edit?usp=sharing'>here</a>. If you happen upon a card that you believe is not working as it should and it is not on that list, it would help immensely if you would submit an issue on <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/gryffon/ringteki/issues'>GitHub</a>. Other comments and/or feedback can be left on GitHub as well.</p>

                    { /*<h3 id='interactions'>Specific Card Interactions</h3>*/ }

                    <h3 id='mmode'>Manual Mode</h3>
                    <p>Most of the cards should be implemented, but if things go wrong, or someone misclicks, or you really hate automation, you can switch on
                    Manual Mode by typing /manual in chat.</p>
                    <p>In Manual Mode, the game will no longer resolve conflicts automatically - the attacking player will be asked to indicate who won
                    the conflict.  You will also get the option to use a Manual Action in action windows which puts an announcement in chat and passes priority
                    to your opponent, but won't have any other in-game effect.</p>
                    <p>In manual mode, clicking cards and rings will bring up a menu which allows you to easily change the game state. Most of the functions in
                    these menus mirror the Manual Commands listed below, but there are a couple of things which can only be done in menus.  The ring menu lets
                    you flip a ring, which you can use to change the conflict type during conflicts.  You can also change the contested ring by selecting the
                    ring you want to switch to and choosing the appropriate menu button. Finally, there is also an option to initiate a conflict in case someone
                    passed by accident. NB: Initiate Conflict can only be used during a pre-conflict action window, and it won't count against your conflict
                    opportunities for the turn.</p>

                    <h3 id='commands'>Manual Commands</h3>
                    <p>The following manual commands have been implemented in order to allow for a smoother gameplay experience:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>/discard x - Discards x cards randomly from your hand</li>
                        <li>/draw x - Draws x cards from your deck to your hand</li>
                        <li>/give-control - Give control of a card to your opponent.  Use with caution</li>
                        <li>/reveal - Reveal a facedown card.</li>
                        <li>/duel - Initiates an honor bid for a duel.</li>
                        <li>/move-to-conflict - Moves one or more characters into a conflict.</li>
                        <li>/send-home - Sends a character home from a conflict.</li>

                        <li>/add-fate x - Add 'x' fate to a card.</li>

                        <li>/rem-fate-ring ring x - Remove 'x' fate from 'ring'.</li>
                        <li>/claim-ring ring - Claim 'ring'.</li>
                        <li>/unclaim-ring ring - Set 'ring' as unclaimed.</li>
                        <li>/honor - Move the state of a character towards honored.</li>
                        <li>/dishonor - Move the state of a character towards dishonored.</li>

                        <li>/manual - Activate or deactivate manual mode (see above).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id='conceding'>About Stats, Conceding, and Leaving Games</h3>
                    <p>Jigoku Online does not rank and/or match players by skill level in any way. There are three categories (beginner, casual and competitive) to be chosen when creating a game which gives an indication of what to expect, but it doesn't enforce anything. Even though personal stats are not being tracked, most players still very much appreciate a formal concede by clicking the ‘Concede’ button and typing ‘gg’ before leaving a game. The reality of quick and anonymous online games dictates this won’t always happen though, as evidenced by regular complaining in the main lobby about people leaving without conceding. Our advice is to just move on to the next game since in the end, conceding or not doesn’t really impact anything. Happy gaming!</p>
